DESCRIPTION:
  HTML Structure:

The calculator consists of a display section (<input> element with id="display"), where the result or current input is shown.
Below the display, there are buttons arranged in a grid layout for numbers (0-9), basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), a clear button (C), and an equal button (=) to compute the result.
Functionality:

Numbers: The appendNumber() function adds the corresponding number to the display when a number button is clicked.
Operators: The setOperation() function sets the arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) for the calculation.
Clear: The clearDisplay() function clears the display when the "C" button is pressed.
Result: The calculateResult() function evaluates the mathematical expression in the display when the "=" button is clicked.
External Files:
